# Full Screen NoEscape for Safari

A small Safari extension to disable the default behaviour of Safari exiting OS X Full Screen Mode when the Escape key is pressed.

## Download

Go to [the latest release](https://github.com/richjddavis/safari-fullscreen-noescape/releases/latest) and download the `safari-fullscreen-noescape.safariextz` file.

## Installation
Double-click `safari-fullscreen-noescape.safariextz` to install.

## Notes & Caveats
By nature, this extension requires access to "all web sites", including secure ones. Because it only monitors for the Escape key to prevent default behaviour, there is no security or privacy concern with this. You can also inspect the source code yourself!

Due to the way in which this extension works (injected JavaScript before a site is loading), there are a few notable situations in which it will not function correctly:

* On the New Tab page (extensions such as this are not loaded)
* If you are using Safari's Development Tools, and keyboard focus is on that frame
* Any other edge cases where JavaScript extensions are not available

It's also possible (however unlikely) that this could interfere with websites that have their own special behaviour when the Escape key is pressed.

## Build

After `git clone`ing, add `safari-fullscreen-noescape.safariextension` to Safari's Extension Builder (`Develop â†’ Show Extension Builder`). You will first need to enable `Show Develop menu in menu bar` in Safari's Advanced preferences.
